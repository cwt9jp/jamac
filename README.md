# JAMAC Website Repo

This is the JAMAC (**J**unior **A**lbemarle **Ma**th **C**ompetition) website repository, currently hosted at [cwt9jp.github.io/jamac](https://cwt9jp.github.io/jamac/).
Currently, the page's JS and CSS are not linked properly, as we are moving the website to one under a root domain.

## Things to do

- [ ] How do we decide overall team??
- [ ] Finish previous-competiton page
- [ ] Now that we make our previous competitions avaliable to the public, we should try to never exactly repeat problems
