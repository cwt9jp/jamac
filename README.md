# JAMAC Website Repo

This is the JAMAC (**J**unior **A**lbemarle **Ma**th **C**ompetition) website repository, currently hosted at [cwt9jp.github.io/jamac](https://cwt9jp.github.io/jamac/).
Currently, the page's JS and CSS are not linked properly, as we are moving the website to one under a root domain.

## Things to do

- [ ] Decide on a DNS provider (likely Cloudflare) and domain name
- [ ] Move site to new DNS
- [ ] Get the JAMAC Logo (currently placeholder) and `main-banner` image
- [x] Get more previous competitions
- [ ] Decide how to do registration for Fall JAMAC (HTML form or Google form?)
- [ ] How do we decide overall team??
- [ ] Schedule seems a little long... too much time for grading (we can grade during competitions and tiebreaks)
