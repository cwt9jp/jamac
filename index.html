            <h2>What is JAMAC?</h2>
            <p>
                JAMAC (<strong>J</strong>unior <strong>A</strong>lbemarle <strong>MA</strong>th <strong>C</strong>ompetition)
                is a low-stakes, fun mathematics competition for middle schoolers in the Albemarle region, organized by the
                Albemarle High School Math Club and Math Honor Society. The competition takes place at
                <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DtDJoVPDDcUntPNx6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Albemarle High School</a>,
                usually on a weekend, and lasts 5-7 hours. The competition consists of individual and team events whose problems
                generally tend to get harder. More specific information is available below:
            </p>

                    <h4>Algebra Round</h4>
                    <p>15 questions, 30 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Problems consist of functions, equations, and algebraic manipulation involving
                        one or more variables, that require converting problems into math equations.
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "Algebra round" is a rather ambiguous term, as all rounds require the use of algebra (to some
                            extent). As such, the Algebra round doesn't require outside knowledge of topics like Combinatorics
                            or Geometry, just on algebraic/graphical topics and a general understanding of numbers and the real world.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Example problems</h5>
                        <p>
                            <b>Easy:</b> Reed selects a three-digit number and subtracts it from \(1000.\) After, the result is
                            doubled. Once it has been doubled, he adds \(7\) to the result. What is the largest number Reed can get?
                            (2024 Algebra Round #1)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Medium:</b> Vivian can make a paper ring in 4 hours. Weining can make a paper ring in \(6\) hours.
                            Amy can make a paper ring in \(8\) hours. If all \(3\) are making paper rings together, how many hours will
                            it take them to make \(13\) paper rings? (2021 Algebra Round #2)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Hard:</b> What is the remainder when \(7^{100}\) is divided by \(3?\) (2024 Algebra Round #10)
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    </button>
                    <h4>Geometry Round</h4>
                    <p>15 questions, 30 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Problems require using algebraic problem-solving skills to find areas, volumes,
                        and side lengths of various 2d and 3d shapes.
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The Geometry round is the harder of the three individual topics, as problems in this round are not
                            as intuitive as in other rounds, requiring more complete knowledge of Geometry and more intuitive
                            problem-solving skills. As such, the scores in this round tend to drop faster than in other rounds.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Example Problems</h5>
                        <p>
                            <b>Easy:</b> Mark Watney is stranded on Mars. His greenhouse has a ceiling consisting of triangular
                            glass panes. One of the equilateral triangles has all sides equal to \(4.\) What is the triangle's area?
                            (2024 Geometry Round, #1)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Medium:</b> On Coney Island there is a circular Ferris Wheel that is \(100\) feet tall. It takes \(120\)
                            seconds for the Ferris Wheel to make a complete revolution. When Taylor Swift is sitting on a bench
                            at ground level she sees that Selena Gomez is \(30\) feet in the air. What is the sum of the two
                            possible times it takes for Selena to reach the ground? (2021 Geometry Round, #4)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Hard:</b> Captain Picard's new combadge is pictured in the figure shown. Point D is the center of the circle.
                            \(\angle{ABD}\) and \(\angle{ACD}\) are \(20^\circ .\) What is the value of \(x\)?

                    </button>
                    <h4>Number Theory Round</h4>
                    <p>15 questions, 30 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Problems consist of numeric manipulation and knowledge of geometric and arithmetic
                        sequences and summations. Counting and probability is also included in this section.
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Formerly the General Round (considered too vague of a name), this round has more practical
                            applications of math in the real world, like probability, counting, and other data-related
                            topics.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Example Problems</h5>
                        <p>
                            <b>Easy:</b> On Cornelia Street there are \(1,313\) apartments. \(871\) apartments are painted
                            blue, \(351\) apartments have new Maseratis, and \(329\) apartments are not blue nor have new
                            Maseratis. How many apartments are painted blue AND have new Maseratis? (2021 General, #2)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Medium:</b> The amount of messages in a bottle that Taylor Swift has can be expressed as the
                            value of \((2+4+6+8+2022)\)\(-(1+3+5+7+2021).\) How many messages in a bottle does Taylor Swift have?
                            (2021 General, #8)
                        </p>

                            <b>Hard:</b> Each term in a sequence after the second is defined by \(t_{n} = 2\cdot t_{n-1} \cdot t_{n-2}.\)
                            If \(t_{5} = 1152,\) find \(t_{1}.\)
                        </p>

                    <h4>Finals Round</h4>
                    <p>15 questions, 30 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Problems consist of all three topics: Algebra, Geometry, and Number Theory, but require
                        more advanced problem-solving techniques. Only the top 12 mathletes can compete
                        in this round.
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The Finals round is technically a tiebreaker for the overall best individual award.
                            However. we let the top 12 mathletes compete instead of just the people able to receive
                            it (more info <a href="#what-if-there-is-a-tie">below</a>). As this round has some of
                            the hardest problems in the competition, we include it as an individual event but don't
                            offer any awards for the highest scorer as the round is technically a tiebreaker.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Example Problems</h5>
                        <p>
                            <b>Easy:</b> Yoda has nine different books lined up on a bookshelf: two math, three physics,

                    <p>10 questions, 15 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Problems on a wide variety of math-related topics, fairly hard but designed to be solved
                        by a team of four people. Teams have to decide how to split up problems, as problem difficulty
                        increases rapidly from problems 1 to 10.

                            This round requires background knowledge, problem-solving, leadership, and
                            team cooperation. As there is so little time, teams have to efficiently distribute problems
                            to give them the maximum time on each question.

                            it will last for \(24\) hours. If he is using it constantly, the battery will only last for \(3\)
                            hours. Since his last recharge, Wall-E has been on for \(9\) hours, and during that time he has
                            used energy for \(60\) minutes. If he continues to leave his battery on, how many more hours will

                    <h4>Guts Round</h4>
                    <p>30 questions, 30 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Guts round (also on various math-related topics) is a fast-paced, chaotic, team event featuring
                        live scoring and problem drip-feeding.
                    </p>

                            In this event, teams start with one sheet of paper with three problems. Once a team believes their
                            answers are good enough, they turn that sheet of paper in and receive the next set of three problems.
                            In total, there are ten sets of problems, with each set being harder than the last. Grading is done by
                            multiplying the set number and the amount of correct answers. For example, if a team turns in their 6th set
                            and they get two problems right, 12 is added to their score. Live grading is done for the first five sets.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Example Problems</h5>
                        <p>
                            <b>Easy:</b> The TARDIS is a rectangular prism with a height of \(10\) ft, a width and depth of \(5\) ft,
                            and a volume of \(1250\) ft. What is its surface area? (2024 Guts Round, Round 1, #3)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Medium:</b> At Albemarle High, there are \(498\) students in 9th grade. There are \(188\) students in
                            "Saving the Turtles Club" and \(63\) students in the "VSCO Girl Club". \(197\) students aren't in either club.
                            How many 9th graders are in both clubs? (2020 Guts Round, Round 5, #1)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Hard:</b> Two squares are chosen at random on a chessboard \((8\times 8)\). What is the probability that they share
                            a side? (2020 Guts Round, Round 10, #2)

                For the non-finalists, during the Finals Round we host a non-competitive game of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(puzzle)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Awards</h3>
            <p>
                We offer bronze, silver, and gold (colored) medals to the three highest scorers of the Algebra and Number Theory rounds.
                As the Geometry round is the hardest of the three, we offer a trophy to the first place finisher instead of a gold medal.
                We also offer a bronze medal, silver medal, and trophy for the overall individual award, given to the three individuals
                with the highest sum of scores from the three individual events, plus the Finals Round.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, we offer awards to the teams with the highest scores in each team event; Team round and Guts round.
                (how do we calculate overall team award????)
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-if-there-is-a-tie">What if there is a tie?</h2>

            <p>
                With the low amount of questions in each category, there is a high likelihood of two or three-way
                ties occurring in all events. JAMAC has a Tiebreak Round to decide rankings, designed to eliminate ties fairly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mathletes will be given 3 questions to solve, whose topics will depend on which event we are breaking
                a tie for. For example, a tie for first in the Algebra Round would mean tiebreak problems are
                algebra-related. There is a seven-minute time limit, but contestants can submit the problems anytime before
                the time limit. <strong>We grade accuracy OVER time.</strong> For example, if one contestant submits before a second
                contestant, if the second contestant gets a perfect score and the first contestant makes a mistake, the second contestant
                will be ranked higher. On the other hand, if both contestants have the same score, the first contestant will be ranked
                higher.
            </p>
            <p>
                We only break ties if an award can be given to multiple people (the overall individual tiebreak is the Finals Round). Team
                tiebreaks will work similarly to individual tiebreaks, with teams instead, and there will be four questions.
