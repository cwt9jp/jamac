                The Albemarle Math Honor Society and Math Club are hosting two JAMAC events this year,
                one in the fall and one in the spring. For more information on these events,
                please check out our <a href="fall-2024/">Fall 2024</a> and <a href="spring-2025/">Spring 2025</a> webpages.
            </p>

            <h2>What is JAMAC?</h2>
            <p>
                JAMAC is a low-stakes, fun mathematics competition for middle schoolers in the Albemarle region, organized by the Albemarle High School Math Club
                and Math Honor Society. The competition consists of individual and team events (whose problems progressively get harder), further explained below:
            </p>

            <h3>Individual events (click to expand)</h3>
            <div class="individual-events-grid">
                <div class="event">
                    <h4>Algebra Round</h4>
                    <p>15 questions, 30 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Problems consist of functions, equations, and algebraic manipulation involving
                        one or more variables, that require converting problems into math equations.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="event">
                    <button type="button" class="contract-button">
                        <img src="images/exit.svg" />
                    </button>
                    <h4>Geometry Round</h4>
                    <p>15 questions, 30 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Problems require the use of algebraic problem-solving skills to find areas, volumes,
                        and side lengths of various 2d and 3d shapes.
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The Geometry round is the harder of the three individual topics, as problems in this round are not
                            as intuitive as in other rounds, requiring more complete knowledge of Geometry and more intuitive
                            problem-solving skills. As such, the scores in this round tend to drop faster than in other rounds.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Example Problems</h5>
                        <p>
                            Easy: Ender has designed a game to play at his space battle school. In his game, a rectangular box
                            with side lengths \(x,y,z\) has a surface area of \(3\). Another rectangular box has size lengths \(3x,3y,3z\).
                            What is the surface area of this new box? (JAMAC 2024 Geometry Round, #6)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Medium: On Coney Island there is a circular Ferris Wheel that is \(100\) feet tall. It takes \(120\)
                            seconds for the Ferris Wheel to make a complete revolution. When Taylor Swift is sitting on a bench
                            at ground level she sees that Selena Gomez is \(30\) feet in the air. What is the sum of the two
                            possible times it takes for Selena to reach the ground? (JAMAC 2021 Geometry Round, #4)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hard: Captain Picard's new combadge is pictured in the figure shown. Point D is the center of the circle.
                            \(\angle{ABD}\) and \(\angle{ACD}\) are \(20^\circ\). What is the value of \(x\)?
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="event">
                    <h4>Number Theory Round</h4>
                    <p>15 questions, 30 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Problems consist of numeric manipulation and knowledge of geometric and arithmetic
                        sequences and summations. Counting and probability is also included in this section.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="event">
                    <h4>Finals Round</h4>
                    <p>15 questions, 30 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Problems consist of all three topics: Algebra, Geometry, and Number Theory, but require
                        more advanced problem-solving techniques. Only the top 12 mathletes can compete
                        in this round.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Team events (click to expand)</h3>
            <div class="team-events-grid">
                <div class="event">
                    <h4>Team Round</h4>
                    <p>10 questions, 15 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Problems on a wide variety of math-related topics, fairly hard but designed to be solved
                        by a team of four people. Teams have to decide how to split up problems, as problem difficulty
                        increases rapidly from problems 1 to 10.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="event">
                    <h4>Guts Round</h4>
                    <p>30 questions, 30 minutes</p>
                    <p>
                        Guts round (also on various math-related topics) is a fast-paced, chaotic team event.
                        Problems are given out in groups of three, and the next set of problems is only available after
                        submitting the previous set. Later sets are harder than previous sets, and there is live grading
                        for the first five sets.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                During the Finals round, a fun, non-competitive trivia round is held, with rules similar to jeopardy.
            </p>

            <h3>Awards</h3>
            <p>
                We offer awards to the highest three scorers of each individual event; Algebra, Geometry, and Number Theory,
                and Finals. We also offer an overall individual award, given to the three individuals with the highest
                sum of scores from the four tests.
            </p>

            <h2>What if there is a tie?</h2>

            <p>
                With the low amount of questions in each category, there is a high likelihood of two or three-way
                ties occurring in all events. JAMAC has a Tiebreak Round to decide rankings, designed to eliminate ties fairly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mathletes will be given 3 questions to solve, whose topics will depend on which event we are breaking
                a tie for. For example, a tie for first in the Algebra Round would mean tiebreak problems are
                algebra-related. There is a seven-minute time limit, but contestants can submit the problems anytime before
                the time limit. <strong>We grade accuracy OVER time.</strong> For example, if one contestant submits before a second
                contestant, if the second contestant gets a perfect score and the first contestant makes a mistake, the second contestant
                will be ranked higher. On the other hand, if both contestants have the same score, the first contestant will be ranked
                higher.
            </p>

            <p>
                These tiebreaks will only be used to decide who wins the above awards. Ties below that will not
                be resolved.
            </p>
